# Valyrian Vocal

Are you a Daenerys fan ?

Or,

Maybe a fellow GOT nerd ?

Well whichever category you might fall into, you might have heard of that Valyrian Steel being the strongest and finest weapon material or maybe Daenerys referring that she is from Old Valyria.

## Valyria, what ?

All of these mentions have the term 'Valyria' in common, & one might ask that it is. Well, Valyria, also called Old Valyria, is a ruined city in Essos. It is a long-dead city of wonderment, and was once the capital of a great empire called the Valyrian Freehold. It was destroyed by a cataclysmic event known as the Doom of Valyria a century before Aegon's Landing. It is the ancestral home of House Targaryen, House Celtigar, and House Velaryon.

And, as you might have comprehended by now, Valyrian (as, in the noun) is the language spoken in Valyria. So now that we are clear with Valyrian & it's roots, we can move onto what Valyrian Vocal is ?

## Introduction

Well as it's name might suggest, [Valyrian Vocal](https://valyrianvocal.netlify.app/) is a web app that can help you vocalize yourself in Valyrian; meaning that it can translate your English to Valyrian.

_This project is made with [Fun Translation's API](https://funtranslations.com/api/valyrian). Check them out, if you want more pop culture centric APIs or translators._

_Please Note - Since I am using the public API(free version) calls, the web app only handles 5 requests per hour due to ratelimiting by Fun Translation's API. So only 5 translations can be done in an hour. I know it might sound brutal to hardcore fans; Least I did around this is preventing your translations from being unresponsive, by making the app tell you if all the translations for an hour have been exhausted or not. And if exhausted, when to try again._
